<h1>About this website</h1>
<br>
<p1>Hello my name is Zachary Blocher and I am a sophmore computer
    science student at Virgina Tech. I am making this website in order
    to show off some of my coding abilities. I am making this using the
    django framework in python as well as HTML and javascript. This is 
    only the start of the website and I will soon use bootstraps in
    order to make the website look a lot better.
